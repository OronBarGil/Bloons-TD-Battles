# Bloons TD Battles Game

This project appears to be a local implementation of a game inspired by Bloons TD Battles, likely involving client-server interaction over a network.

## Project Files

* `BTD_Client.py`: The client-side application.
* `BTD_Server.py`: The server-side application.
* `balloon.py`: Likely handles balloon objects and their behavior.
* `balloon_data.py`: Probably contains data related to different types of balloons.
* `button.py`: Might define button elements for a user interface.
* `monkey.py`: Likely handles tower (monkey) objects and their behavior.
* `monkey_data.py`: Probably contains data related to different types of monkeys (towers).
* `playground.py`: Could define the game map or environment.
* `tcp_by_size.py`: Likely a utility for handling TCP communication with size prefixes.
* `world.py`: Might manage the overall game state and interactions.

## How to Run

1.  Start the server by running `python BTD_Server.py`.
2.  Start one or more clients by running `python BTD_Client.py`.

Further instructions on how to play or configure the game might be available within the client and server scripts.
